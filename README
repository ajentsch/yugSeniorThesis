The only required software package for this analysis script is ROOT.

To analyze "generator level" MC files (HEPMC):

the code can be run with "root -l analyzeHEPMCEvents_MC.cxx"

Note: please use a ROOT 6.3 version, or greater, to avoid issues.

To analyze the EICRECON fully reconstructed output, use the following sequence of commands, initially:

mkdir reconstructionOutput

[copy data files into this directory]

check "inputFileList...." to ensure the list is current.

Check analyzeEICRECONEvents.C to ensure correct list is being read-in.

root -l analyzeEICRECONEvents.C
